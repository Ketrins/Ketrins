# Amelia Hinsen's Biography

👋Hello, I'm Amelia Hinsen, an active student learning Python programming at "Logica_school." 
I already have expertise in three Python libraries: Turtle, PyQt5, and Pygame.

💻I've always been fascinated by programming languages, and my future plans include mastering languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, React, TypeScript, and Next.js. 
I believe expanding my language toolkit will make me a more effective developer.
